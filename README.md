## A performance benchmarking project comparing sequential CPU merge sort with GPU-accelerated sorting using CuPy.

The project measures execution time across increasing dataset sizes, analyzes CPU vs GPU speedup, and visualizes results using Matplotlib.

Includes:

Custom Python merge sort implementation (CPU)

GPU sorting with CuPy

Accurate synchronization for fair timing

End-to-end benchmark (transfer + compute)

Log-scale performance plots

Useful for learning about parallel computing, GPU acceleration, and performance measurement in Python.
